				<p>Visiting the original after a remake can be jarring but also a pleasant surprise. Final Fantasy 7 is not my first entry in the series and will absolutely not be my last. 
				My thoughts on the pacing were jarring at first because of how quickly you clear the beginning area, meanwhile in the remake it is the entire 40+ hour experience. Of course afterwards 
				I adjusted and made sure my eyes and emotions were for this game and not any of its sequels or prequels.</p>

                <p>Enough about the remake/maybe sequel, this 1997 adventure is one that does not stop. The pacing is that of a well-made rollercoaster. 
				I never wanted it to end and I did not at any point feel held back or rushed.</p>

                <p>This is a 3-person party turn-based journey that allows the freedom of play style per player. The materia system that’s provided begs for experimentation and doing so is very fulfilling. 
				It’s a system that holds up 26 years later, and I never found myself tired of the random encounters because of variety provided in the combat.</p>

                <p>Thematically speaking, Final Fantasy 7 is a powerful story about environmentalism. To put it loosely without spoiling mid to late game themes, it’s also about life and the effect people have on each other and the planet. 
				While this game was made more than two decades ago, the themes about protecting the planet and over usage of natural resources hold up very well today. Despite having heavy themes, the game knew when and how to have fun. 
				Whether it was situational or the interaction with your surrounding environment, there are great moments to share with this cast of characters. It’s silly, serious, heavy, and a great time. My only complaint with the characters is that I wish some had more time on screen. 
				There are also optional characters that provide some context to the world and story that can be easily missed out on. While not crucial, I do think that context is still something everybody should see.</p>

                <p>For a lot of positives there were of course some negatives. Both technical and within the experience. I played the Steam version of the game on my Steam Deck, and what was news to me is that this game does not provide a cloud save (which is a bit ironic). 
				This becomes an issue with the port more so than the game and at most it’s a minor inconvenience not being able to easily switch over.</p>

                <p>I never found myself struggling over any enemy. As far as JRPGs go, this was a breeze minus the optional super enemies. Main story enemies were well balanced for whatever level the game expected you to be. 
				Compared to other games that place difficulty spikes or are way too easy, this felt just right.</p>

                <p>I was aware of this game’s soundtrack beforehand and knew what to expect. A primarily orchestral soundtrack with other genres blending in to fit the mood. For me personally, the music holds a lot of the game together and this does so much more than that. 
				There was a moment where it glued me in, and that’s when you reach the overworld when the main theme plays. There’s so much emotion placed into that track; it’s like equivalent to an overlook melancholic sigh.</p>

                <p>As somebody without the nostalgia filter for this game, I can say it is overrated. Maybe if I played it when it came out I would hold it higher than I do currently. I can respect how influential it is and how valued it is by others. 
				Just because I find it overrated does not mean it’s not worth experiencing. It’s a great game with great themes and an amazing soundtrack. The cast deserves more time together in this game; I am not including its prequels or sequels. 
				This is a game with a story that challenges its players with themes about environmentalism that are still very relevant today. From beginning to end you’re given a unique adventure that provides many emotions. 
				For a game that came out 26 years ago, it holds up incredibly well and is something I am glad to have experienced when I did.</p>
