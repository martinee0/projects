				<p>This was a game I was looking forward to heavily but also skeptical because of how the marketing made it seem. My expectations
				felt in the correct place after my experience with Fire Emblem Engage.</p>
			
				<p>I thought the level designs were really fun until they would spam reinforcements to lengthen chapters unnecessarily. 
				The enemy AI felt a little weird because of how they prioritized your units for damage output, so it’s a guessing game of who they target, 
				but I got used to it over time.</p>

				<p>There’s a time crystal that acts like the Divine Pulse in Three Houses but with 10 charges. 
				It felt super forgiving at first, but I found myself thankful for it towards the endgame. This could 
				have either been because of the mass amounts of enemies they would throw at your or just personal skill issue.</p>

				<p>The story is a cornball mess with lame characters and writing. 
				There are emotional moments that felt super unearned and predictable plot points—a huge eye roll overall.</p>

				<p>A lot of the dialogue felt really lame, and I just didn’t care for anybody except the units that carried my weight hard. 
				But even then, they didn’t provide me with enough depth to learn about them. 
				You really get the most out of a character with the "Where Are They Now?" when you beat the game, and even still, it’s super unearned and forgettable.</p>

				<p>This game's music was boring for me, except for maybe a handful of tracks. 
				I won’t include the songs from previous games you can find during preludes. Even the songs that are good, 
				I personally didn’t find to be worth writing home about, except maybe two. (One is what you can here in this review!)</p>

				<p>I was indifferent to the fan service provided from previous Fire Emblem characters. I've played some of the previous titles and 
				seeing those I would recognize did nothing for me. Ultimately all their dialogue was just, "Hey, I’m this hero and you’re my friend."</p>

				<p>There are a lot of characters that aren’t shown a lot of love unless they’re main characters—and even still, it’s barebones. 
				This is annoying because they don’t exist unless you use them, so you just lose them to the void of a character list because 
				you will literally not see them in a cutscene unless you do a support interaction. This is an arguement that can be said for the
				franchise as a whole, especially when the cast ends up being a large amount of people.</p>

				<p>The home base Somniel was super dead like the monastery, so thank the game allowed
				fast travel within itself for the important stuff.</p>

				<p>I would’ve dropped it if the gameplay didn’t rock this much because I really was not a fan of about everything else.
				That being said, I would consider myself a 'loyal' buyer and will continue supporting this series in hopes it finds the highs 
				I found myself feeling with the 3DS titles.</p>
