            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
				<ol>
                
					<li><h3>Do you play through the whole game and then review?</h3></li>
                    <p>I personally believe I can only fully review a game after I have completed it and gone through the credits. 
					Sometimes it may differ based on if the game was just not for me or some other factor. But I do prefer to give my thoughts on 
					whether or not the highs and lows that one would experience early on would last the entire time.</p> 
             
                    <li><h3>Is there a rating system you follow?</h3></li>
                    <p>I think the number ratings you see elsewhere have so much subjective power. 
					For example you can see a 7/10 and people think the game just isn't worth it. Others may understand it as "good". 
					Ratings have gotten to a point where if it isn't something higher than an 8 then why bother? I personally believe how I would write about a game and my experience with it is something more telling than a number.</p>
           
               
                    <li><h3>How do you choose the games to review?</h3></li>
                    <p>Whatever is calling to me in my never ending backlog or an anticipated release is how I usually go about choosing something that would eventually be reviewed. 
					I'd like to think eventually maybe taking requests and going about it like that? But I can only play so much until it becomes more job than leisurely.</p>
