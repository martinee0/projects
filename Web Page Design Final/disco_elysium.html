				<p>I started this game as a drunk detective with amensia mid investigation, and it spiraled in every direction from political and philosophical 
				stances that can influence just about every conversation I have with anybody. It’s literally such a work of art.
				While being in its own fictional world it manages to parallel the real world incredibly well.</p>

                <p>The amount of well-voiced dialogue is insane; there’s so much to discover. The soundtrack is melancholy; 
				I just want to sink to the earth's core and melt on the painted canvas that is this beautiful art style. (If you couldn't tell,
				this game has me head over heels.)</p>

                <p>When the game chooses to get serious it really doubles down. I felt my heart stop any time there was an ounce of history 
				on the character you play as. It is legitimately an understatement how well written everything is and how well done the narrative is. 
				For how 'free form' it is based on the player's actions, it is so well-crafted.</p>

                <p>This is Dungeons and Dragons without combat; it’s so powerful. 
				It’s so evidently a work of passion and effort with the ridiculous paths you can take just to get something as simple as cigarettes.</p>

                <p>This game's trailers I don’t think do it justice; there’s so much to uncover you can’t see it 
				in a 2-minute timespan without spoiling or ruining the bends and turns that is this story.
				Disco Elysium is an experience that feels different every playthrough.</p>

                <p>Please play this game; it’s so worth it beyond belief. I think everybody should experience it. 
				I feel so empty and so fulfilled at the same time.</p>

                <p>It’s so beautiful how it depicts everything emotionally and socioeconomically.</p>

				<p>I have an urge to say so much but this is something that should be experienced blind. Take the word of mouth 
				that only expresses praise because this game can not be anything other than amazing.</p>
