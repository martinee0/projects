                    <p>Since this is run by me I might as well introduce myself! For now until I think of something cooler, my name is Matt and I have been gaming since 2004. I won the lottery of millennial big brother who introduced me to cool classics and put me onto this path of a broad genre interest. As for what specifically I am into, the range is literally further than the eye can see (with some exclusions). I've been following most of the big AAA releases from companies such as:</p>

            <p>If the photos to the side or my little list didn't convince you, then perhaps my reviews would in due time. 
			If I were asked on the street for my main squeeze of video games, I would like to believe JRPGs take that. I do think that, despite how time consuming, JRPGs are my ultimate super big time favorite genre.</p>
