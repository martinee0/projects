These projects were either done through my education or my free time.

- Web Page Design Final is a website I created in the form of a game review website while also acting as a personal blog while still remaining thematic to video games.

- Tabletop Project.SQL was a project I had worked on with the idea of mixing a video game I personally really liked and with a tabletop game similar to Dungeons and Dragons.
